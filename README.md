# EnergyDEX
EnergyDEX is a decentralized exchange built on the Cardano blockchain that facilitates trading of energy derivatives and tokens. The exchange aims to provide a secure and transparent platform for energy market participants to trade energy products without the need for intermediaries. EnergyDEX leverages the security and scalability of the Cardano blockchain to provide a decentralized and trustless platform for energy trading.

Architecture
EnergyDEX is composed of several components:

backend_infrastructure: This folder contains the backend infrastructure code for EnergyDEX. It includes the necessary code for interacting with the Cardano blockchain, managing user wallets, and processing transactions.

contracts: This folder contains the smart contract code for EnergyDEX. The contracts include asset tokenization contracts and derivative contracts.

dex: This folder contains the decentralized exchange code for EnergyDEX. It includes the necessary code for order matching, executing trades, and managing the order book.

frontend: This folder contains the frontend code for EnergyDEX. It includes the user interface for the decentralized exchange, allowing users to interact with the exchange and perform trades.

governance: This folder contains the code for the governance model of EnergyDEX. It includes the necessary code for token voting, proposal submission and voting, and the distribution of funds.

security: This folder contains the security measures implemented in EnergyDEX to prevent hacking and other security breaches. It includes the necessary code for user authentication, secure data storage, and transaction validation.

token: This folder contains the code for the native token used on EnergyDEX. The token is used for payment of transaction fees, and for participation in the governance model.

Development
EnergyDEX is developed using the Plutus programming language and is built on the Cardano blockchain. Developers interested in contributing to EnergyDEX can follow these steps:

Clone the EnergyDEX repository.

Install the necessary dependencies by running the command npm install in the frontend folder.

Start the frontend by running the command npm start in the frontend folder.

Write and test smart contracts using the Plutus Playground.

Deploy the contracts to the Cardano blockchain using the Cardano CLI.

Test the decentralized exchange by creating orders and executing trades.
